I was first given Trovan for a horrible infection in my leg combined with riphampin( now off the market) in 1999. By 2000 I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, an autoimmune disease much like rhumetoid arthritis. Since then, I've can't count the times I've been give either Levaquin or Cipro for a simple bladder infections, gum infections and most recently for cellulitis. I have now been diagnosed with Fibromialgia , vision problems, have constant joint pain, developed trigger fingers, depression, chronic fatigue, skin rashes, itching ..I'm so sick of being sick and I'm convinced it's from the Drs indecriminent writing of these antibiotics. I will never take them again and would rather risk another allergic reaction than deal with feeling like crap 24/7. I have warned my daughter never to take anything in that class of drugs."

Took dose in store and walked around the retail section for another 10 minutes.  Began walking to car in drugstore parking lot...started to notice charley horse type symptoms starting in both leg calves.  The symptoms got worse and I felt like the seizing muscles were going thru my entire body.
Barely was able to make it back to urgent care only two parking lots away.  They had me stay there for about 2hours making sure the side effects went completely away then prescribed non leviquin antibiotic for me.  I was told never to use leviquin or its family again  and believe me, I will not."
2,levaquin,"Been reading the blog - thank God.  Thank God I stopped taking this poison after 2nd dose.  I became disoriented, paranoid, severe neck pain with crackling, head pressure, metallic taste in mouth  and left eye trauma.   I called a holistic friend of mind and he told me to take EMERGEN-C 1,0000 mg that is sold in drugs stores.  Take it at least 3 times a day and 4 if you can immediately.  I took it on day 3.  Also walk, move stretch and try not to panic.   Also sweat in a sauna or jacuzzi.  After I did all this the fogginess has subsided along with the eye thing.  Still have the neck problem but is lessening - now just on left side and slight crackling.    Still feel top of head pressure - but is lessening.  Friend explained that the Levaquin attaches to the Vitamin C and flushes out with water.  Also get a Vitamin B shot. ... more »Been reading the blog - thank God.

It wasn't pneumonia but a bronchial infection and it took 4 to 5 weeks  to  get rid of it.

I cannot taste or smell a pot of coffee brewing...it has an awful smell and I thought it was the coffee pot and that the coffee somehow became contaminated until during a recent visit  to my daughter's home, I experienced the same awful taste and smell when she brewed some coffee.

I first noticed it when I went to turn over in the bed...it was a minor groin twinge...3 days later I asked Dr. about it because it was radiating further out into my hip and strangely, sometimes my neck area.  Dr. said it was a pulled muscle.  It's unbearable at night...no position is comfortable.  I was ready to settle on a Bursitis explanation, but this Lisinopril information gives me food for thought.....last month my dosage was upped from 10 to 20 mg.  Yesterday, the Doc upped it to 30 mg...I haven't started that dosage yet as I'm very afraid of side effect....of course exploded heart from 160/100 BP isn't a preferable side effect. Eeeeek!"

This time, however, about an hour after taking the first dose I got the ""never felt so sick in my life"" feeling others have reported here.  I got into the bathroom and barely had the strength to get up off the floor to the toilet to void my intestines, alternating with throwing up in the tub.  Then I started violent shivering, teeth chattering, mitigated a little by a heavy bathrobe and blanket, in a room that was already at 78 degrees.  My oral temperature measured only 89 degrees!  After about 6 hours all this subsided enough for me to get into bed for a fitful sleep.  Fortunately I seem to be back to normal the next day."

In May, 2012, I was told my irises are now translucent and the pupil no longer dilates.  I have been doing research online and I've found other cases that sound similar to mine.  My online research is revealing that Avelox may be the cause of my Iris Atrophy.  If anyone has info on this, please reply!  It is so frustrating!  I am being treated with prosthetic iris contact lenses which help a lot with the sun sensitivity.  I'm curious what treatment others like me are doing?  Is there any way to prove Avelox is the cause of this?"

He is one of the good guys. God knows there aren,t many left!! His number:215-731-9900 ext.105. He will speak to you . Perhaps we can get a class action suit filed in federal court!!

The only warnings I saw were not to take aluminum or magnesium with this drug on the bottle and to avoid sunlight.  So much for trusting the dr. to check on drug interactions.  I have fibro so this might also be a factor as people with immune disorders should not take it.  The doctor mentioned none of this!  After reading this article I am afraid this will continue.

 I can't even sit now because of the intense joint and hip pain. All of my joints are burning. My shoulders and tendons in my legs are very bad, but this hip pain is a shocking. To add to this, my feet and fingers are numb. Things are showing up and getting worse by the day. How can this be? I have been hurt badly by this drug. Doctors Please.....the danger!   Nerve damage? Tendons rupture? Heart damage?.....and it kills germs too. Heck......just take a big swallow of gasoline next time you get a little infection. I don't know if it can kill everything Cipro can....but the damage couldn't be any worse . At least there is hope treating that. They would at least try to treat the side effects caused by drinking gasoline.... there is no treatment for Cipro poisoning.     "

I was prescribed Cipro when I came back from a trip to Central America with a mysterious fever that had lasted for 6 days.  My dosage was 500 mg, 2x a day.  After the second day, I started having wrist pain. Day 3 it spread to one angle, and on day 4 both ankles and both wrists. Day 5 I stopped taking the drug, as I realized it wasn't my own mild activity causing this pain. I have now been off the drug for 9 days, and the joint pain has escalated terribly. I have severe pain in both ankles and in 1 knee. The other knee hurts, but is slightly more flexible. I hope hope hope that this pain will go away soon, because I am almost completely immobilized despite several full days of rest, elevating the joint, taking anti-inflammatories, using braces, etc. It is really remarkable how harmful this drug is, and I just hope to heal from those 10 doses I took soon, and I wish my doctor and/or pharmacist had said something.

I experienced light headedness and a loss of concentration.  Initially I did not attribute these symptoms to Cozaar, because they came on gradually.  I never needed glasses before Cozaar, my appetite was the same, and I was not on any other prescription drug.  About 6 months ago, I decided to ween myself off of Cozaar.  During that time I have lost about 20 lbs, without dieting--eating the same way I did on Cozaar.  My concentration and energy level has increased, and my vision has improved--I don't need reading glasses anymore.

I had left mast. a month after and then had chemo on June till Sept. My last PET scan was inconclusive so my oncologist put me on femara. I have been taking it for 5 mos. now. I experienced slight pain in my right arm early December of 08 and told my onco that it might be the femara causing it. He dismissed that and said that I have arthritis. Now the pain is also in my other arm which extends to both shoulders. I have problems with my range of motion in both arms now and is thinking of just quitting Femara. I have also pain in my inner thigh muscles and have spasms cause by sudden movements. Occasional insomnia and  frequent hot flashes are other side effects I have to suffer. I don't know if it is worth continuing with the little percentage of advantage in the long run and at present live with a diminished quality of life.

However, a few months after starting it, I began to develop severe constipation.  I reported it but was told that this was probably not a side effect of Questran.  After taking it for six months, I stopped on my own as the constipatin became very severe. Also, my blood tests showed a huge rise in triglycerides and my triglycerides had always been low.  Even though I had stopped this drug, I still developed obstipation and had to be admitted but the doctors diagnosed me as having an eating disorder (I had become emaciated) and discharged me).  However, a few months later I had humongous pain and an x-ray showed blockage in the colon.  I had to be re-admitted on an urgent basis and 2/3 of my colon had to be removed.

My Dr. told me to take a double dose each day--before long I had what felt like a cessation of intestinal function---very constipated and a feeling of rawness in my inestine---and felt quite ill, along with having a lot of pain in my gut.

When I finally stopped taking it because of the pain I was experiencing,   then I realized the other side effects were part of the medicine.  My hair stopped falling out, my memory came back slowly but to a point where I realized the drug definately had something to do with it.  After a few months my legs came back to normal.  Two different doctors told me that this could not be  because these symptoms were not listed as side effects.   It is a known fact that not all meds work for ALL people!!!  When you explain all of what you are feeling they just about laugh at you.
I am so sick of these doctors that give you drugs just because they are there without first trying other alternatives. I do believe that doctors have way too much faith in the DRUG COMPANIES. We all understand that SOMEm not all doctors do get kick back from drug companies."

So here is it 
Triglyceride is nothing but a fat molecule and brain uses fatty acids from fat to create a special cell that allow us to think and feel. This does not come from me but it comes from Research and you can find the link at www dot fi dot edu and click on resource for learning and then search for fats and brain.  I have been been taking Welchol 625mg on and off for a year now. And it has helped me reduce my fat molecule. Genetically by body produces more Triglyceride then most people. Human body would not produce.This ester group of molecule when inhibited by Welchol the body must adjust and find alternative method to perform the function that it normally performed with these triglyceride(fat - an ester). People as they grow older are set in their ways because their body ecosystem is set in their ways. When the body is not able to produce the necessary fat molecule on its own and there is no substitute via supplements of fish oil one is going to feel dizzy, cold, numbness in the arm( may be related to heart). So what i did was I reduce the dosage and allowed by body some time to adjust to the medication I also took fish oil ( even though I am a Vegetarian) and Now my Triglyceride are low, my numbness in the arm is gone, I do not feel dizzy or nausea. So try and allow your body to make amends by constantly monitoring progress and regress. These companies do not educate doctors on dosage problem. And each individual has different ecosystem makes it challenging to generalised without being wrong. And when doctors are wrong it very serious matter for everybody including the doctors."

Now I do not remember this happening the last time or any of the other nauseau I had the first few weeks or flue like symptoms.  However I feel my body is starting to get used to it.  I am fighting however mentally as to what I really want.  Do I want to take this and feel tired all the time but have less pain?? I know my Doctor will want to increase this dose as I remember I took 100 mg the last time and will not go up from this 25 mg twice a day.

I knew it was the pill and got off but no doctor believed it could possibly be the cause.  The extreme panic attacks stopped a week after stopping the pill but the anxiety and lack of emotion has remained for 3 years now. I am on and off anxiety meds now.  I used to have that madly in love feeling and I considered myself a really strong person emotionally but all that flew out the window in 4 freaking days! I can ""fake"" emotions now but it is like there is a disconnect between my brain and my emotions. For ex I may think/know something is funny but I emotionally have to force a laugh or smile.  It comes as second nature now but you never really forget what it was like before and what normal feels like. I hope some dr starts realizing the emotional connection to this med and they all stop prescribing it.  I even have a friend on the pill and she is having same problems now but keeps listening to docs and won't stop taking the pill. Worst Med Ever Created! Thanks Bayer!"

I'm 20 YEARS OLD!, This is just not ok for me) And this last side effect has been freaking me out fr weeks until I finally spoke to my Pharmacist. I woke up and smelled coffee, dirty laundry and fabric softener. My room is clean and the laundry room is 4 doors down from mine, a good distance away. The kitchen is across my house from my bedroom. All day I smell the complexity of everything and I ran around my house with febreeze thinking that everything stunk (I am a neat freak btw and no one in my house could smell anything) Candles stink, shampoo is over the top, going outside was literally painful for my nose to handle the scents.

During these 4 years, I have gone through cycles of severe mood changes. I was convinced I was bipolar for a while. Then last month I missed the first two pills in my pack so I skipped the whole month. It was the best month I've had in a VERY long time. I was actually happy all the time, which was such a relief. So this month when I started my pills again and started feeling a little depressed and crazy again I finally made the connection.
I have always been a happy, positive person, but I think Yaz has been affecting me very negatively the last few years. Like many other reviewers, I loved Yaz when I first started taking it. It was the first pill I had taken that actually regulated my periods. Around year 2 though I started becoming very disconnected from my friends and any social contact sounded dreadful. This is coming from a sorority girl... my social life used to be the center of my life.
On top of the depression, last year I began to experience heart palpitations and would become very weak and dizzy and black out in the mornings occassionally. I went to the doctor for this issue and they could not figure out why this was happening after running several tests. They noticed my blood pressure was higher than it should be. I was only 20 years old at the time and in great health. The doctor actually thought my symptoms sounded like a heart attack but ruled that out after more tests. I also began have panick attacks around the same time which scared me half to death because I had never experienced anything like that. The smallest thing would have affect me horribly.
The doctor never made the connection between this issues, but after my experience in not taking Yaz last month and reading more information, I can't help but to think this medication is the cause. I also noticed on the Yaz website that abnormal pap results may be a side effect, and my last pap was abnormal after years of perfectly normal paps.
I will definitely be contacting my GYN asap to discuss switching pills. I will say Yaz has been amazing at keeping my cycle regulated and my periods never last over 3 days, but I can't handle the mood swings any longer, they are beginning to severely affect my relationship."
7,yaz,"I took YAZ for 9 months this year and in retrospect, I can see how connected it is with severe symptoms I had.  It cleared up my skin and made my periods regular, which is of course what I noticed most about it.  But about 3 or so months after starting it, I began to have serious stomach problems.  I cycled between constipation and diarrhea, no rhyme or reason to it; I was afraid to eat anything because it would make me so unbelievably nauseous, but then I would get super faint and anxious if I didn't eat every 2 hours or so; I began to have real emotional ties to this stomach problem and would get a depression when I ate and an anxiety around what it was going to do to me.  My doc thought it was a gluten allergy.  I then started getting migraines at about 5 months in and I've never had a migraine in my 26 years on this earth.  I started to notice an extreme fatigue, never feeling like I got enough sleep.  I was also very disinterested in things and had high levels of anxiety and was developing some phobias.

I cycled between constipation and diarrhea, no rhyme or reason to it; I was afraid to eat anything because it would make me so unbelievably nauseous, but then I would get super faint and anxious if I didn't eat every 2 hours or so; I began to have real emotional ties to this stomach problem and would get a depression when I ate and an anxiety around what it was going to do to me.  My doc thought it was a gluten allergy.  I then started getting migraines at about 5 months in and I've never had a migraine in my 26 years on this earth.  I started to notice an extreme fatigue, never feeling like I got enough sleep.  I was also very disinterested in things and had high levels of anxiety and was developing some phobias.  I really thought something was seriously wrong with me and was honestly scared to go to the doctor as I thought I might have cancer or something."

Initially, I noticed very few side effects like I did with other birth controls.  However, for the past few months, I have been severely depressed and extremely anxious.  Oftentimes,  I feel like I cannot even move and there is very little that gives me any hope.  I really feel like giving up.  Can depression occur slowly over time with this drug?  I am trying to figure out where this mood change suddenly came from.  Help! "

My psychiatrist started me on a low 20 mg. dose of Geodon. First couple of days on it just had a little grogginess.  About 4 days out on the Sat. after July 4th I got up feeling pretty good but felt a very pronounced internal jitteriness and was excessively talking and felt pressured to talk (never been this way before in my life) plus had a suicidal thought. Sunday felt okay and then Mon. night felt jittery and had suicidal thought. I have called my doctor to find out what going on. If I felt bad enough would go to ER. Dont want anyone to worry. I have a spouse who takes great care of me and is understanding. Just wondered if the low dose of Geodon can cause you to rapid cycle like that?  Ive never done that before. Doctor increased my Celexa to 30 mg two weeks ago or so.  So weird. Any advice? Thanks."

I am Bipolar 1 with rapid cycling. The Dr. did not explain a thing about taking the drug, nurses just brought it to be after night meal. 60mg for 3 days then 80 mg... sent home 3 days later. As my strange symptoms (muscles tightening, body feeling like it was held down by weights, clenching jaw, shaking, dizzy, nauseated, and scared out of my mind) were building, I thought I was getting too much of the drug so I went to the ER on Monday and they gave me an RX for 2 doses of 60mg.... 2 days later on Wednesday morning I saw my primary nurse at my Psychiatrist's office, and she filled a 30 day supply for the 60mg's because I convinced her I needed less, but I liked that I was thinking more clearly than I have in years. (like much less memory problems and not getting lost in the middle of what I am saying and being very very articulate.) I thought I had found a cure to my forgetfulness, and had hope. I was determined to figure out the proper dosage so that I could keep taking it and improve my quality of life. Well, after a couple more days the symptoms were horrific, so I thought, again, that I just did not need as high a dose... called the Dr on Friday and asked him to lower it again, because I was still thinking so clearly. He gave me 20mg's and said to try 20 or 40 and see what worked. That evening I took just 20mg and by midday I started having the symptoms... dizzy, strange sensations all over, and muscle weakness. By 5 PM My body felt so very heavy, like I was melting into the couch I was lying on. It was the exact feeling of coming out of anesthesia after surgery and your body is not ""Awake"" yet. I was terrified... and then it hit me that it was drug WITHDRAWAL, not OVERDOSE like I had been thinking...  Oh my God... it is like being a METH addict. I have to eat and take the drug to get this to stop. A family member helped me to get that done as I was too weak to do it for myself. Another family member came to sit with me and calm me down. About 45 mins after taking a 40mg dose I was calming down and my body was recovering a bit. Enough that I trusted them that I could go to sleep and would not die in my sleep. I got more sleep than the 4 hours I have been sleeping the past week. Unfortunately by 7 this morning the withdrawl was kitchen in again. I ran to the kitchen to eat so I could take the drug. By the time I took it I was as weak as a kitten and terrified again. It took over an hour to settle down some. Enough I could take care of my basic needs for a while. This afternoon by 3PM I knew that the symptoms were returning, so I know I cannot wait 12 hrs to take the next dose. It is now 5 PM and I am going to eat and take a 40mg dose. I do not want to go through another terrifying ordeal. Tomorrow morning at 8 AM I will be sitting at my psychiatrist's office finding out how to get somewhere to get off of this poison. It has taken me 3 times longer than usual to type this due to the muscles tightening and starting to slow down. My mind is still clear. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS STILL ON THE MARKET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHAT can we do to get it off???"

I am currently taking prednisone for 7 days.
Has anyone else experienced hearing loss which they attribute to the use of warfarin (coumaden?)  I am desperate for information that might lead me to some sort of enlightenment I could build on.

It is so painful I can hardly move.  I also have gained 10 lbs for no reason at all.  Im suppose to be on this for another 3 months.  I dont think I can last that long!"
